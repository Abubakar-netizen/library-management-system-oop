📚 Library Management System (OOP-Based)
This project is a fully functional Library Management System developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It handles all core operations of a typical library such as managing books, members, issuing, and returning books — all through clean and modular class-based design.

🎯 Project Overview
The system provides a console-based interface for library staff and members to:

Add, delete, and update books

Register and manage members

Issue and return books

View book availability

Maintain transaction history

💡 OOP Concepts Implemented
Concept	Usage in Project
Class	Book, Member, Library, Transaction, etc.
Object	Each book/member is an object instance
Encapsulation	Private data members with getters and setters
Abstraction	Methods hide internal logic (e.g., issue book logic)
Inheritance	StudentMember and FacultyMember inherit Member
Polymorphism	Overridden methods for different member types
Constructor/Destructor	For object lifecycle management
